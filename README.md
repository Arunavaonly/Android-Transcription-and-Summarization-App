# Voice Transcription Mobile App

This is a mobile application built using Capacitor for recording voice, transcribing it, and potentially summarizing the transcription.

## Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)
*   **Core Plugins:**
    *   `@capacitor/core`
    *   `@capacitor/android`
*   **Community Plugins:**
    *   `@capacitor-community/http`: For making HTTP requests (likely to a transcription backend).
    *   `@capacitor-community/speech-recognition`: Potentially for on-device speech recognition capabilities.
    *   `capacitor-voice-recorder`: For handling audio recording.

## Project Structure

*   `public/`: Contains the web application source code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
*   `android/`: Contains the native Android project generated by Capacitor.
*   `package.json`: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.
*   `capacitor.config.json`: Capacitor configuration file (app ID, name, plugins, etc.).
*   `build-apk.bat`: Batch script for building a debug APK locally on Windows.
*   `.github/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows (likely for CI/CD).

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Initialize the Android platform (if not already present):**
    ```bash
    npm run init-android
    # or npx cap add android
    ```
4.  **Sync web assets:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or npx cap sync
    ```

## Development

1.  **Run the web app locally (for UI development):**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will serve the `public` directory.
2.  **Open the project in Android Studio:**
    ```bash
    npm run open-android
    # or npx cap open android
    ```
    You can then run the app on an emulator or a connected device directly from Android Studio.

## Building the App

*   **Build a debug APK (Windows):**
    Run the `build-apk.bat` script or execute the command directly:
    ```bash
    npm run build-debug
    # or cd android && gradlew.bat assembleDebug
    ```
    The APK will be located in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
*   **CI/CD:** Refer to the workflows defined in the `.github/workflows/` directory for automated builds.
